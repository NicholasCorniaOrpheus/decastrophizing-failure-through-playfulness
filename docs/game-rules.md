# Assemblying a narrative

Inspired by the _Open Work_ and _Lector in fabula_ by Italian writer and philosopher [Umberto Eco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco), we have designed a small [game](./game.md) of chance that will help the reader in constructing their own narrative.

Instead of presenting a classical article, fixed by the authors in its static form, we encourage the reader to build their own text, balancing player's agency (introducing metacurrency) with [randomness](./randomness.md) (dice rolls determining the leght of each random walk in the knowledge graph).

Here an example of Knowledge graph build upon a series of concepts:

To determine the next page to be visited, the player will:

- locate the cursor on the current page (root node in the network)
- roll 3d6s (3 six-sided dice) and take the highest result. If the player has no dice (shame on you!) we provide a simple web-simulator:

## Knowledge Walk

- A result of **6** allows the player to walk a path of lenght 3 in the knowledge graph. Furthermore, the player gets a **token**.
- A result of **4** or **5** corresponds to a walk of lenght 2.
- A result of **1**,**2** or **3** corresponds to a walk of lenght 1.


## Tokens

Each player can impose their agency on the otherwise random path by spending, at any time during the walk, a **token** to add or substract the path lenght.

## Narrative log

Players should take a simple log of their journey in the knowledge graph, recording the URLs of each visited page.

Afterwards, with the help of an AI tool or by simply summmarizing, the player will generate their own version of the article.
